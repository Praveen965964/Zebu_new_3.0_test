  <li>The blog is probably one of the company’s most valuable marketing tools. It should be used to build trust with our customers, generate leads, educate customers, and build brand awareness. So, if a reader tells us that the blog’s content quality is poor, that comment will probably make us cringe just a little.</li><br>
  
  <li>The best company blogs are engaging, deliver value, and align with the company’s business strategy. The content which we develop for our blog should help us deliver/develop a consistent brand message.
